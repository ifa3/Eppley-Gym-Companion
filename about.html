        <p>
          Eppley Gym Companion helps UMD students avoid wasted trips to the gym by
          combining estimated crowd levels, simple hours, and local weather.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Students arrive at Eppley without knowing how crowded it is or whether their
            one-time UID entry has already been used.

          <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
          <p>
            UMD students, RecWell staff, and administrators benefit from clearer information
            about capacity and access rules.

          <h2>Data sources</h2>
          <p>
            Supabase stores sample crowd and UID data, OpenCage geocodes Eppley, and
            Open-Meteo provides basic College Park weather.
